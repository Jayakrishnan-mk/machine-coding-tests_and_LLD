ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Core CS Fundamentals (To Fill the Gap)
Since you donâ€™t have a CS degree, weâ€™ll cover the most important CS concepts that come up in backend interviews.

1. System Design Basics
Domain Modeling (Critical for ThoughtWorks-style interviews)

What is domain modeling?

How to model a real-world system (e.g., Uber, Netflix, Twitter) into entities and relationships.

Example: Design a "Ride-Sharing" domain model with entities like User, Driver, Ride, Payment.

Abstract Modeling

Abstraction vs Encapsulation.

How to simplify complex systems using abstraction.

2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) & SOLID Principles
OOP Basics (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction).

SOLID Principles (Very important for interviews!)

Single Responsibility Principle

Open/Closed Principle

Liskov Substitution Principle

Interface Segregation Principle

Dependency Inversion Principle

Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton, Observer, Strategy, etc.)

3. Data Structures & Algorithms (Basic Level)
Since youâ€™re backend-focused, weâ€™ll keep it minimal:

Arrays, Strings, Hashmaps (Most common in interviews).

Basic Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Sliding Window).

Time & Space Complexity (Big-O notation).

ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Backend Development (Node.js + Related Tech)
1. Node.js (Advanced)
Event Loop & Async Programming (Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await).

Worker Threads vs Clustering.

Streams & Buffers.

Error Handling & Debugging.

Security Best Practices (JWT, CORS, Rate Limiting).

2. NestJS (If Interview Requires)
Modules, Controllers, Services.

Dependency Injection.

Microservices in NestJS.

Authentication (Passport.js, JWT).

3. Databases
SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
Indexing & Query Optimization.

Transactions & ACID Properties.

Normalization vs Denormalization.

Joins (Inner, Left, Right, Full).

NoSQL (MongoDB)
Schema Design (Embedding vs Referencing).

Aggregation Pipeline.

Sharding & Replication.

Redis
Caching Strategies.

Pub/Sub Model.

Redis as a Session Store.

4. Kafka (Message Brokers)
Pub-Sub vs Queues.

Kafka Architecture (Topics, Partitions, Brokers).

Consumer Groups & Offsets.

ðŸ“Œ Step 3: Interview Questions (Categorized)
1. Domain Modeling & Abstract Modeling
"How would you model an e-commerce system?"

"Explain the domain model for a food delivery app."

"How do you abstract database interactions in your code?"

2. SOLID Principles
"Give an example where you applied the Open/Closed Principle."

"How does Dependency Inversion improve testability?"

"Whatâ€™s wrong with a class handling both user authentication and logging?" (Single Responsibility).

3. Node.js
"Explain the Event Loop in Node.js."

"How would you handle memory leaks in Node?"

"Whatâ€™s the difference between setImmediate and process.nextTick?"

4. Databases
"When would you choose MongoDB over MySQL?"

"How do you optimize a slow SQL query?"

"Explain Redis use cases in a web app."

5. System Design (Basic)
"Design a URL shortener like Bit.ly."

"How would you scale a real-time chat app?"

ðŸ“Œ Step 4: Action Plan (How to Prepare)
Week 1-2:

Study Domain Modeling & SOLID Principles (Most urgent).

Revise Node.js Event Loop & Async Patterns.

Solve 5-10 SQL & NoSQL problems.

Week 3-4:

Deep dive into Databases (Indexing, Transactions, Redis Caching).

Learn Kafka basics (If required for interviews).

Practice NestJS (If needed).

Week 5+:

Mock interviews (Use Pramp or Interviewing.io).

Solve real-world system design questions.
